icescrum-for-intellij
=====================

  Use [iceScrum](http://www.icescrum.org) (or [iceScrum Pro](https://www.kagilum.com/icescrum-pro/)) as IntelliJ __Tasks__ resource.

  You can choose tasks from your project and start them.<br/>
  Be sure to take a look at the [iceScrum & Intellij integration](https://www.kagilum.com/documentation/) documentation, as it contains a full preview of this plugin.

  Task titles (and reference ID's) are then added automatically to each commit so your iceScrum Pro version (as it have an integration with SVN / GIT) will know that some commit is about some task.
